## Avoid Thread.Sleep

### Bad Practice

Using `Thread.Sleep` blocks the current thread for a fixed duration:

- Prevents other operations from executing on that thread
- Wastes thread pool resources
- Can degrade application responsiveness, especially in ASP.NET, UI, or task-based environments

### Better Practice

Using `Task.Delay` with `await` or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` allows asynchronous, non-blocking delays:

- Frees up the thread to perform other work
- Improves scalability in server apps and responsiveness in UI apps

### Benchmark Results

- Time will be similar (both wait for 2 seconds)
- Memory may be slightly higher in `Task.Delay` due to async state machine overhead, but scalability and responsiveness are much better

### Recommendation

Use `Task.Delay` instead of `Thread.Sleep` unless you're writing low-level threading logic or test scaffolding that explicitly
needs to block the thread.


Why is Thread.Sleep bad?
It blocks the current thread, meaning nothing else can use that thread for the sleep duration.

In ASP.NET or any multi-threaded server environment, blocked threads reduce throughput and responsiveness.

It harms scalability because thread pool threads are a limited resource.

Why is Task.Delay better?
It is non-blocking: the thread is released while the delay happens.

Enables asynchronous execution, allowing other tasks to run during the delay.

Ideal for scalable, asynchronous, and UI apps (e.g., avoids freezing UI or tying up server threads).

But why is memory higher in Task.Delay?
It creates an async state machine and uses internal timers, which adds some memory overhead.

This overhead is negligible in server or large-scale apps compared to the performance/scalability gain.
