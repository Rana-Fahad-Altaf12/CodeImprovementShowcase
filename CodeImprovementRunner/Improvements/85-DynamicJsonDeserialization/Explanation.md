# 85. Using dynamic with JSON deserialize

## Bad
Deserializing into `dynamic`:
- No compile-time type safety.
- Prone to runtime errors if JSON structure changes.
- Harder to maintain and refactor.

## Good
Deserializing into a strongly-typed class:
- Compile-time type checking ensures correctness.
- Easy to refactor and maintain.
- Clear structure for JSON data mapping.

Always prefer strongly-typed deserialization over `dynamic` for safety and maintainability.
