# Improvement #01: Singleton DbContext vs Scoped DbContext

## Problem: Singleton DbContext

In this version, `DbContext` is registered as a **Singleton**, meaning:

- Only one instance exists for the entire application lifetime
- It's reused across **all requests or threads**
- It is **not thread-safe**

### Error Example You Saw
**Exception**:
An attempt was made to use the context instance while it is being configured.
A DbContext instance cannot be used inside 'OnConfiguring' since it is still being configured at this point.


This happens because the **same context is used concurrently**, triggering EF Core’s safety mechanism.

In real apps, this leads to:
- Data corruption
- Race conditions
- Memory leaks from long-lived entity tracking

---

## Solution: Scoped DbContext

By registering it using:

```csharp
services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>();
```
You:

Get a new DbContext per request (or per scope)

Avoid shared state issues

Automatically dispose of context properly

Scoped is the default and recommended lifetime for web apps, APIs, and background workers using EF Core.

**Rule of Thumb**
Use Scoped (or default AddDbContext) for anything EF Core-related
Never use Singleton for DbContext or any service that holds it
