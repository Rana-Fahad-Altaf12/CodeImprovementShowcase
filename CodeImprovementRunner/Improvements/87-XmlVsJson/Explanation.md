# Improvement #87: XML vs JSON

## Bad Example
The bad example uses XML for data serialization/deserialization when JSON would be simpler and more efficient. Issues with XML:
- Verbose and larger payloads
- Slower serialization/deserialization
- Less widely used for modern APIs and services

## Good Example
The good example uses JSON consistently:
- Lightweight and faster
- Standard for modern APIs
- Easier to read, write, and debug

## Key Points
- Use JSON instead of XML when possible, especially for API communication.
- XML is only preferred for legacy systems or when schema validation is required.
- JSON reduces complexity and improves performance.
