# Swallowing Exceptions Silently

## Problem

Catching exceptions and doing nothing (`catch { }`) hides critical failures:

- Makes debugging extremely difficult.
- Errors appear as if the system worked successfully.
- Violates error transparency and reliability principles.

## Solution

At minimum, log the exception or rethrow it:

- `Console.WriteLine` or `ILogger<T>` in production scenarios.
- Use `throw;` to preserve the original stack trace.
- Avoid `throw ex;` since it resets the stack trace.

## Benefits

- Improved observability of failures.
- Easier debugging and root cause analysis.
- Prevents silent data corruption or incorrect flows.

## When to Use

- Always log or rethrow caught exceptions unless you have a **very specific reason** (e.g., retry logic, ignoring harmless cases).
- In APIs, prefer middleware for centralized exception handling.

## Benchmark

This is a **reliability and maintainability improvement**, not a performance one.  
It ensures system correctness and better debugging without affecting execution speed.
